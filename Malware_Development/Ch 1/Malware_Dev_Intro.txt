What is Malware Development?
- Malware is a software designed to perform malicious action

A simple Example
- Malware can be written in any programming language.
Languages: C/C++, Python, Go, Rust, Nim, Powershell, C#

Why C/C++?
1. Low level Accesss to system Resources such as hardware and memory.(Win32 API)
2. Malware that evades antivirus, manipulate system behavior and carry sophisticated attacks
3. Very fast.
4. Portable Malware.

Types of Malware
Def:
    Viruses- A piece of code that attachs them selves to other programs and replicate.
    Worms- Self replicating and can spreed across networks without human intervention.
    Trojans- Pieces of software that appear to be legitimate but actially have a hidden, malicious purpose.

Malware Behaviors:
1. Backdoors: allows attacks to remotely control the target machine.
2. Downloaders: Installs on targets and then installs other malicious software.
3. Trojan: Computer friendly virus.(Keyloggers, Backdoors, Rootkit)
4. Remote Access Trojan(RATs): Provide an attacker with complete control over the target  machine.
5. Steelers: provide access to sensitive data.
6. Bootkits: Affects the master boot record(MBR). Persistence



Reverse Shells
- Utilize standard outbound ports(80,443,8080)etc
Stages to create Reverse shell:
1. Attacker exploits a systemm or network flaw that allows code execution on the target
2. An adversary then installs a listener on their own system.
3. The vulnerability is exploited by attacker, injecting reverse shell on a vulnerable system.
