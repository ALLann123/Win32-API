WINDOWS API
WinAPI in c++ is like talking directly to windows itself.
Learn how to create windows, handle events, draw on the screen, 
work with file, processes, threads, networking.

WinAPI
-Is a collection of functions, constants, and data types provided
by Microsoft to interact with the windows operating system.
- Written in C but can be accessed in C++.

With winAPI you can:
* Create and manage windows(GUI programming).
* Handle keyboard and mouse input.
* Draw graphics and text.
* Work with files, memory and processes.

Handle- in winAPI is a pointer that allows us to modify and work with a subject


HANDLE: is like a reference or pointer to a window object-- in this case, a processes


OpenProcess() is a Windows API function that tries to get access to
a running process
a) PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS->You're requesting all possible permissions on the
process(read, write, terminate, etc).
b)FALSE-> Means you do not want the handle to be inheritable
by child processes.
c)processID-> The ID of the process you want to open
