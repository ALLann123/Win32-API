**OFFENSIVE C++: GETTING STARTED WITH WIN32 API**
-Crucial for offensive security.

WHAT IS THE WINDOWS API?
Programs often require access to modify windows subsystem
or hardware but are resricted to maintain machine stability.
problem solved: Ms created win32 API.

Example: "WriteProcessMemory"- Writes data into a specified region of the memory's process.

UserMode: environment where most applications run but has
limited operations to prevent harm to the system.

Kernel Mode: Code has unrestricted access to all system resources
including hardware. operations that require direct interactions with 
hardware or critical system components are executed in kernel mode.


DEVELOPMENT environment
Why C++?
Widely used for its efficiency and ability to directly manipulate hardware
resources. Good for low-level programming and offensive security tasks.

Practicle Example 1: Creating a MessageBox
"MessageBox" displays a dialogue box containing a messege. The function is 
part of the User32 library in the Win32 API.
Visit= simple_message_box.cpp

Practicle Example 2: Process Enumeration
-More API calls for process Enumeration. Usefull for offensive security
for understanding the processes running on a system.
FUNCTIONS:
1) CreateToolhelp32Snapshot: Takes a snapshot of the current specified
process, heaps, modules and threads used by the process.
        /*
        HANDLE CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(
        [in] DWORD dwFlags,
        [in] DWORD th32ProcessID
        );
        */
2) Module32First: Retrieves information about the first module associated
with a process.
3) Module32Next: Retrieves information about the next module associated with
a process or thread.
